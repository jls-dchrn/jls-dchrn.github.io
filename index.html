    <h1>Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jules, here are some of my personal projects.</p>
    </header>

    <main>

        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Personal Teacher Assistant</strong><a href="https://github.com/jls-dchrn/PersonalTeacherAssistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔗</a> </li>
            <p>
                An LLM-Based assistant for childrens needing a tutor to study or do their homework.
                The goal is for the assistant to help the children by decomposing the problem step by step without giving him the answer.
                Is also implemented a summary of the current session to assets the children streghts and weeknesses and adapt to his learning pace.
            </p>
            <li><strong>VOC detection</strong><a href="https://github.com/jls-dchrn/VOCdetection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔗</a></li>
            <p>
                VOCs or Volatile Organic Compounds are a family of indoor gases which can cause different kind of side effects when the go over certain thresholds.
                This project provide the arduino code and the instructions to build a VOC gas detector.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Generate PDF</strong><a href="https://github.com/jls-dchrn/GeneratePDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔗</a></li>
            <p>
                Sometime for some benchmarks, we need PDFs which will vary only from a few number of parameters like the number of pages or the number of tables.
                This code have been used to make different benchmarks on the <a href="https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docling-serve</a> github.
                It use the reportlab library.
                Because there is no tools select the number of pages to fill with text, it have been done experimentally, there is room for improvement.
            </p>
            <li><strong>HGSS pokemon tileset</strong><a href="https://github.com/jls-dchrn/ HGSS_pokemon_tileset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔗</a></li>
            <p>
                Some tileset are hard to use because they need to be manually processed. This is the case for the one from SirMalo on DeviantArt.
                This project provide ready to use tilesets for Pokemon Essential on RPGMaker XP.     
            </p>
             <li><strong>Understand Neural Networks</strong><a href="https://github.com/jls-dchrn/understand_Neural_Networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔗</a></li>
            <p>
                A collection of notebook explaining how Neural Networks works and how to use Pytorch to create them.   
            </p>
        </ol>
